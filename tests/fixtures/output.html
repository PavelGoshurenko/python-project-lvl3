   How is TinyTIM associated with Tiny Tim?
  </h1>
  To tell the truth, not a whole lot. When TinyTIM was founded in 1990, we
chose the name because the vast majority of MUDs up at that time were
using the naming convention of "
  <i>
   Tiny-
  </i>
  " and a name. (For example,
TinyMUD, TinyHELL, etc.) and we were started as a parody of these places.
TinyTIM could refer to the singer or to the Charles Dickens character,
but either way it was "funny."
  <p>
   Time passed, of course, and it was inevitable we would learn more about
the singer, and while TinyTIM itself still doesn't make a big fuss or
hullabaloo about Tiny, we did start to gain a real understanding of the
man and his work in this world.

    A couple of the 
wizards even met him at one point
   </a>
   , at a concert he gave in Boston.
This meeting inspired a eulogy upon his sad passing in 1996.

<h1>How is TinyTIM associated with Tiny Tim?</h1>

To tell the truth, not a whole lot. When TinyTIM was founded in 1990, we
chose the name because the vast majority of MUDs up at that time were
using the naming convention of "<I>Tiny-</I>" and a name. (For example,
TinyMUD, TinyHELL, etc.) and we were started as a parody of these places.
TinyTIM could refer to the singer or to the Charles Dickens character,
but either way it was "funny."

<P>

Time passed, of course, and it was inevitable we would learn more about
the singer, and while TinyTIM itself still doesn't make a big fuss or
hullabaloo about Tiny, we did start to gain a real understanding of the
man and his work in this world. 

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.tim.org/pub/tim/WIZARDS/tinytim2.jpg">A couple of the 
wizards even met him at one point</A>, at a concert he gave in Boston.
This meeting inspired a eulogy upon his sad passing in 1996.
